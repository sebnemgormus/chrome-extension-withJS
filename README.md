# Chrome Extension

A tool created with HTML, CSS,and JavaScript according to instructions from the Frontend Developer Path course by [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/). 
It includes 3 features which are SAVE INPUT, SAVE TAB, and DELETE ALL.

* SAVE INPUT - Saves any URL that passes it with input. 
* SAVE TAB - Grabs the current page's URL and saves it as a list. The data inside of the list persisted, so if you close down the app or Chrome, or turn off your computer, the data will be still there. 
* DELETE ALL -  Deletes the saved URL list.
